React js notes:
===============



what is  React is really ?

> React js is  offically  defined as "javascript library for creating  user interface";
  but what does it really  mean?

> react is library made in javascript and which we code  javascript  to, built great  application  that
  can run on the web .

============================================================================

  what do  I need to know to React?

  > simply to say basic of javascript  to become a solid react programmer.

  > The  most basic  javascript oncepts you should be familiar with are variables,
     basic data types, conditionals, array methods, functions, and ES modules.
======================================================================


 If React is made in javascript , why don't we just use javascript?

 > while React js was written in javascript , which was bulit  from the ground  up  for  the
   experts for buliding web applications and give us tools to do so.

 > javascript is more then  20 year old programming language  which has created  for adding small bits
    of behaviour to the browser  through scripts  and was not designed  for creating computer applications.

>  JavaScript was used to create React, they were created
    for very different purposes.
===============================================================================

Can I use JavaScript in React applications?

> Yes! Any valid JavaScript code can be included within your React applications.

> You can use any browser or window API, such as geolocation or the fetch API.

> Also, since React (when it is compiled) runs in the browser, you can perform
  common JavaScript actions like DOM querying and manipulation.

How to create react app?

> Three different ways to create a React application

1.Putting React in an HTML file with external scripts.

2. Using an in-browser React environment like CodeSandbox.

3.Creating a React app on your computer using a tool like Create React App. 

=================================================================================

What is the best way to create a React app?

> If you want to create a complete web application that you want to ultimately
  push to the web, it is best to create that React application on your computer
  using a tool like Create React App.   

> The easiest and most beginner-friendly way to create and build React apps for
  learning and prototyping is to use a tool like CodeSandbox. You can create a
  new React app in seconds by going to react.new!

JSX Elements: JSX is a powerful tool for structuring applications
============
              > JSX is meant to make create user interfaces with JavaScript applications
                easier.
               
              > JSX borrows its syntax from the most widely used programming language:
                HTML .


              > As a result, JSX is a powerful tool to structure our applications.
              


              > The code example below is the most basic example of a React element which
                 displays the text "Hello World"  .  



                 <div>Hello React!</div>





How JSX differs from HTML?

> We can write valid HTML element in JSX, but what differs slightly is the way
  some attributes are written. 




> Attributes that consist of multiple words are written in the camel-case syntax i.e
  (className) nd have different names than standard HTML ( class ). 
                       

                   
                         <div id="header">
                         <h1 className="title">Hello React!</h1>
                         </div>

> The reason JSX has this different way of writing attributes is because it is
  actually made using JavaScript functions.
